The `pigeon_build_runner` is a powerful Dart package that seamlessly integrates the `pigeon` package with the `build_runner` package, enhancing the efficiency and simplicity of code generation for Flutter projects. The package acts as a bridge between `pigeon` and `build_runner`, streamlining the communication process and automating the code generation workflow.

### Getting Started
To use pigeon_build_runner in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Dependencies
Add the following dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

dev_dependencies:
  pigeon: ^<latest_pigeon_version>
  build_runner: ^<latest_build_runner_version>
  pigeon_build_runner: ^<latest_pigeon_build_runner_version>
```
Make sure to replace \<latest_pigeon_version>, \<latest_build_runner_version>, and \<latest_pigeon_build_runner_version> with the most recent versions available. You can find the latest versions on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

#### 2. Include a pigeon folder
If you have your pigeon files placed outside the lib folder in your Dart project, you will need to create a `build.yaml` file to configure the build system properly. This step is necessary to generate the necessary code from your pigeon files.

**Note:** If you have all your pigeon files placed inside the lib folder, you can skip this step and proceed directly to Step 3.

Here's how you can do it:

1. In the root directory of your Dart project, create a new file named `build.yaml` if it doesn't already exist.

2. Open the `build.yaml` file in a text editor of your choice.

3. Add the following configuration to the `build.yaml` file:

```yaml
additional_public_assets:
    # Add the directories containing your pigeon files here, relative to the root directory
    - path/to/pigeons/directory/**
```

Replace `path/to/pigeons/directory` with the actual relative path to the directory where your pigeon files are located. Make sure to indent the lines properly as shown in the example.

#### 3. Configure your project

Open the pubspec.yaml file in your Flutter project.

Add the following configuration under the `pigeon` key.

It's not mandatory to include outputs for all languages mentioned below. Feel free to configure only the outputs that are necessary for your requirements.

**Note:** Replace paths with the essential paths for your project configuration.

```yaml
pigeon:
  # main-input defines default values and base paths or package names
  main-input:
    input: pigeons/
    dart:
      out: lib/src/pigeons/ 
      test-out: test/pigeons/
    ast:
      out: lib/src/pigeons_ast/
    objc:
      header-out: ios/Runner/
      source-out: ios/Runner/
      # Set this to a unique prefix for your plugin or application, per Objective-C naming conventions.
      prefix: PGN
    java:
      out: android/app/src/main/java/dev/flutter/pigeon_example_app
      package: your.package.name
    swift:
      out: ios/Runner/
    kotlin:
      out: android/app/src/main/kotlin/dev/flutter/pigeon_example_app
      package: your.package.name
    cpp:
      header-out: windows/runner
      source-out: windows/runner
      namespace: CppNamespace
  inputs:
    - input: my_pigeon.dart
      dart:
        out: my_pigeon.dart
        test-out: my_pigeon_test.dart
      ast:
        out: my_pigeon_ast.dart
      objc:
        header-out: my_pigeon.g.h
        source-out: my_pigeon.g.s
      java:
        out: MyPigeon.g.java
        # Adding `.` before a package will join a package name from main-input with the package belowe
        # Result: your.package.name.additional.package.name
        package: .additional.package.name
      kotlin:
        out: MyPigeon.g.kt
        # Adding `.` before a package will join a package name from main-input with the package belowe
        # Result: your.package.name.additional.package.name
        package: .additional.package.name
      swift:
        out: MyPigeon.g.swift
      cpp:
        header-out: my_pigeon.g.h
        source-out: my_pigeon.g.cpp
```

Using main-input is not mandatory, but it greatly aids in defining base paths for input/output folders and package names, effectively reducing boilerplate.

Alternatively, you can have the tool automatically generate the input files for you by including `inputs-inferred: true`. This will generate files according to the base paths defined by the `main-input.input` key. If a language is not included in `main-input`, no outputs will be generated for that language.

```yaml
pigeon:
  # automatically generate outputs based on discovered input files
  inputs-inferred: true
  main-input:
    input: pigeons/
    # only files for dart, swift, kotlin, and c++ will ge generated
    dart:
      out: lib/src/pigeons/ 
      test-out: test/pigeons/
    swift:
      out: ios/Runner/
    kotlin:
      out: android/app/src/main/kotlin/dev/flutter/pigeon_example_app
      package: your.package.name
    cpp:
      header-out: windows/runner
      source-out: windows/runner
      namespace: CppNamespace

```

It is important to note that due to limitations with the `build_runner` interface, files added during build sessions when `inputs-inferred: true` are "pseudo-tracked" by this package. This means `build_runner` doesn't actually know about them, and subsequent build sessions will find them as conflicting files. Rest assured, all `.pigeon.xxx` files generated by this package are safe to delete despite these warnings.

##### Path configuration

If the path begins with a forward slash `/`, the main package folder will be utilized.

```yaml
pigeon:
  main-input:
    input: pigeons/
    dart:
      out: lib/src/pigeons/ 
  inputs:
    - input: first_pigeon.dart
      dart:
        out: first_pigeon.dart # lib/src/pigeons/first_pigeon.dart
    - input: second_pigeon.dart
      dart:
        out: /lib/custom_folder/second_pigeon.dart # /lib/custom_folder/second_pigeon.dart
```

##### Package configuration

Also, if the package doesn't start with dot `.`, the package from `main-input` will not be used.

```yaml
pigeon:
  # main-input defines default values and base paths or package names
  main-input:
    input: pigeons/
    java:
      out: android/app/src/main/java/dev/flutter/pigeon_example_app
      package: your.package.name
  inputs:
    - input: first_pigeon.dart
      java:
        out: FirstPigeon.g.java
        package: .additional.package.name # your.package.name.additional.package.name
    - input: second_pigeon.dart
      java:
        out: SecondPigeon.g.java
        package: another.package.name # another.package.name
```
